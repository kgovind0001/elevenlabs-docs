## Getting Started

Before you install the ElevenLabs Python library, there are a few prerequisites to make your system ready:
- Install Python 3.6 or higher
- Access pip package manager 
- [Register](https://elevenlabs.io/sign-up) with ElevenLabs

The ElevenLabs library also requires the following components for audio playback:

**ffmpeg**
For Mac: Install using `brew install ffmpeg`
For Linux and Windows: Refer to [https://ffmpeg.org/](https://ffmpeg.org/)

**mpv**
For Mac: Install using `brew install mpv`
For Linux and Windows: Refer to [https://mpv.io/](https://mpv.io/)

### Install Latest Python Library Version

To install the latest version enter the following command:

```python
pip install elevenlabs
```

This will download and install the package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

For development versions, you can install directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

```python
pip install git+https://github.com/elevenlabs/elevenlabs-python
```

Now the library is ready to import into your code:

```python
import elevenlabs
```

### Authenticate ElevenLabs API

The next step is to authenticate with your free API key, which provides additional usage quota. 

You can [sign up](https://elevenlabs.io/sign-up) for free on the ElevenLabs dashboard to obtain a key.

Next, you need to set the key in your Python code:

```python
from elevenlabs import set_api_key

set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

With everything set up, you're ready to start using the ElevenLabs library. 

### Initializing first text-to-speech

With the ElevenLabs library imported and authenticated, we can now generate our first text-to-speech audio output.

The `generate()` function handles all text-to-speech generation. It takes in the text to synthesize as well as options to specify voice, language, and other parameters.

For starters, let's use it with just the text:

```python
from elevenlabs import generate 

audio = generate("Hello world! This is my first text-to-speech using ElevenLabs.")
```

This will use the default voice and settings to produce an audio object containing synthesized speech.

We can now play back audio using the `play()` function:

```python
from elevenlabs import play

play(audio)
```

Within seconds we hear the inputted text spoken in a natural voice.

The default voice uses ElevenLabs' proprietary expressive English voice model. We can also customize the voice by passing a voice parameter to `generate()`:

```python
audio = generate("Welcome to ElevenLabs!", voice="Amy")
```

Here is all the code used in this section combined for convenience:

```python
pip install elevenlabs  
import elevenlabs

from elevenlabs import set_api_key

set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")

from elevenlabs import generate  
  
audio = generate("Hello world! This is my first text-to-speech using ElevenLabs.")

from elevenlabs import play  
  
play(audio)

audio = generate("Welcome to ElevenLabs!", voice="Amy")
```

There are dozens of natural voices to choose from. That's just the beginning of the customizations available, which we'll explore more in the next sections.


## Core Features

The ElevenLabs Python library offers two primary capabilities: high-quality text-to-speech and voice cloning.

### Text-to-Speech

The generate() function is used for text-to-speech conversion. Supply it with text, and it provides an audio object with synthesized speech.

To generate speech in various languages, use the model parameter:

```python
# Multiple languages  
audio_en = generate("Hello world!", model="eleven_multilingual_v2")  
# English
audio_mono = generate("Hello world!", model="eleven_monolingual_v1")
```

Numerous voices are accessible for each language. You can specify a voice using its ID or name:

```python
audio = generate("Hi there", voice="Amy")
```

You can also customize aspects like pitch and speaking rate using VoiceSettings:


```python
from elevenlabs import VoiceSettings  
  
settings = VoiceSettings(speaking_rate=0.8)  
audio = generate("Welcome to our podcast!", voice="Amy", settings=settings)
```

For real-time applications, utilize `stream=True` to receive the audio in fragments:

```python
audio_stream = generate("Hello world", stream=True)
```

Here is all the code used in this section combined for convenience:

```python
# Multiple languages  
audio_en = generate("Hello world!", model="eleven_multilingual_v2")   
# English  
audio_mono = generate("Hello world!", model="eleven_monolingual_v1") 
audio = generate("Hi there", voice="Amy")
from elevenlabs import VoiceSettings  
  
settings = VoiceSettings(speaking_rate=0.8)  
audio = generate("Welcome to our podcast!", voice="Amy", settings=settings)
audio_stream = generate("Hello world", stream=True)
```

### Voice Cloning

ElevenLabs lets you clone voices with a minimum of 30 seconds of audio samples. Provide sample files to the clone() function:

```python
from elevenlabs import clone
voice = clone(
   name = "My Cloned Voice",
   files = ["sample1.mp3", "sample2.mp3"] 
)
```

Then generate speech using the cloned voice.

```python
audio = generate("Hello world!", voice=voice)
```

With just these two capabilities - high-fidelity text-to-speech and voice cloning - many applications are possible with ElevenLabs. 

### Cloning from samples

For optimal cloning results, deliver at least 30 seconds of diverse high-quality audio samples, covering styles like storytelling, casual talk, and more. Ensure there are pauses and tonal variations.

Save these as individual files, preferably in WAV or FLAC format:

```python
files = [  
  "clip1.wav",  
  "clip2.flac",  
  "clip3.wav"  
]
```

Pass the samples to clone():

```python
voice = clone(  
  name="Bob",  
  description="A friendly voice",  
  files=files  
)
```

This will upload the samples and kick off voice cloning to create a synthetic version.

Also once the voice is cloned, it will have a unique ID. You can save this ID for future references, so you won't need to clone the voice again.

```python
voice_id = voice.voice_id
```

### Customizing Cloned Voices

While the cloned voice mirrors the provided samples, you can further fine-tune voice settings:

```python
from elevenlabs import VoiceSettings  
  
settings = VoiceSettings(speaking_rate=1.1, pitch=0.9)  
voice = clone(name="Bob", files=files, settings=settings)
```

### Using Cloned Voices

Employ the cloned voice with the `generate()` function:

```python
audio = generate("Hello!", voice=voice)
```

If you want to use `voice_id` instead then:

```python
audio = generate("Hello!", voice=voice_id)
```

This cloned voice can be applied universally. It's possible to save this voice for later use across multiple projects.

### Streaming Audio

With the ElevenLabs package, you can efficiently stream audio in real-time.

To generate audio in streaming mode, use the `stream=True` parameter with the generate function:

```python
from elevenlabs import generate

audio_stream = generate("Hello world", stream=True)
```

This returns a generator that yields audio chunks as they become available.

To play streamed audio, you need to collect the chunks and play them sequentially. For example:

```python
from elevenlabs import generate, stream

  
audio_stream = generate("Hello world", stream=True)  
for chunk in audio_stream:  
  stream(chunk)
```

This allows playing audio with minimal latency, useful for real-time applications. 

ElevenLabs usually delivers latency of less than one second. Latency is as low as 500 ms in some cases.


## Advanced Usage

In this section, we’ll explore advanced functionalities such as controlling speech parameters, leveraging SSML, and handling extensive text, among other aspects.

### Controlling Speech Rate, Volume, etc.

In this section, we’ll look at how to achieve nuanced control over speech synthesis with the generate function. Here's how to customize specific attributes:

**Voice:** Determine the tone of the output. You can specify a voice name, voice_id, or even use a Voice object. The Voice object allows fine-tuning attributes like stability and similarity boost.

```python
voice = "Bella"   # Using voice name  
audio = generate("Hello!", voice=voice)
```

**Model:** Select a speech synthesis model. Specify either a model name or directly pass a Model object.

```python
model = "eleven_monolingual_v1"   # Using model name  
audio = generate("Hello world!", model=model)
```

### Handling Large Texts

When dealing with extensive texts, streaming can be beneficial. Using the stream=True parameter in the generate function returns audio incrementally. This approach is particularly effective for long-reads or when latency is a concern. The streaming chunks are optimized by setting the latency parameter, but the 5000 character limit still remains.

```python
audio_stream = generate("A long piece of text...", stream=True, latency=2)  
for chunk in audio_stream:  
    # process or play each chunk
```

### Monitoring Usage and Costs

The User API object helps monitor your subscription details, like the remaining character quota. Keep tabs on your usage to manage costs efficiently.

```python
from elevenlabs.api import User  
user = User.from_api()  
print(user)
```

#### Optimization

To minimize costs while maintaining quality:

**API Key Management:** Ensure you set your API key. It offers better quotas and capabilities over the default setting.

```python
from elevenlabs import set_api_key
set_api_key("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

**Voice Selection:** Optimize by selecting voices and models apt for your project rather than using defaults.

**Stream for Lengthy Content:** For longer content, use the streaming feature to conserve resources.

#### Adding breaks / pauses

If you want to insert a break in the text, you can use the following `<break time="1.5s" />` directly in the text where you want the break to happen. The AI can handle breaks of up to 3 seconds in length, and these are not just cuts in the audio. These are proper natural breaks.

```
"Give me one second to think about it. <break time="1.0s" /> Yes, that would work."
```

## Troubleshooting

Working with advanced voice generation tools like the ElevenLabs Python library can sometimes lead to unexpected issues or errors. Here’s a compilation of common pitfalls, errors, and their solutions to ensure a smooth experience with the library.

### Installation Issues

*Error: pip is not recognized*

**Solution:** Ensure you have the pip package manager installed. For Python 3, you might need to use pip3 instead of pip.

*Error: Conflicting dependencies*

**Solution:** This could be due to other packages requiring different versions. Try creating a new virtual environment using virtualenv or venv and then install the ElevenLabs library there.

### Authentication Errors

*Error: API key not set or invalid*

**Solution:** Double-check your API key for any typos. If you’re copying it from a website or document, ensure there are no leading or trailing whitespaces. If the error persists, verify the API key's validity in the ElevenLabs dashboard.

### Text-to-Speech Issues

*Error: Unsupported language or voice*

**Solution:** Confirm that the language or voice ID you provided is supported by ElevenLabs. Refer to their documentation for a list of supported languages and voice options.

*Error: Text length exceeds limit*

**Solution:** The generate() function might have a character limit for individual requests. Break the text into smaller chunks and call the function multiple times if needed.

### Voice Cloning Issues

*Error: Audio sample too short*

**Solution:** Ensure your voice samples are at least 30 seconds long. The more diverse and high-quality the samples, the better the cloning results will be.

*Error: Unsupported audio format*

**Solution:** Make sure your audio samples are in a supported format, preferably WAV or FLAC. Convert any unsupported formats to a supported one using audio editing tools or online converters.

### Streaming Issues

*Error: Stream buffer underflow*

**Solution:** This can occur if the playback consumes audio faster than it's being generated. Adjust the latency parameter or implement buffer controls to handle this.

*Error: Audio is choppy during playback*

**Solution:** Ensure that the network connection is stable. If you’re processing audio chunks, ensure that the processing isn't causing delays. Try reducing the complexity of any real-time processing or increasing buffer sizes.

### General Issues

*Error: Library functions not working after an update*

**Solution:** Check the ElevenLabs documentation or changelog for any breaking changes. Update your code accordingly or consider reverting to a previous version of the library.

*Error: Unexpected costs or usage*
