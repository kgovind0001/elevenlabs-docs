We provide here seven methods for reducing streaming latency, in order of highest to lowest effectiveness:

- **Use Turbo v2 model (recommended)** â€“ 
Our cutting-edge Eleven [Turbo v2](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/speech-synthesis/models#turbo-v2) is ideally suited for tasks demanding extremely low latency. The model is found to have a latency of  around 400ms consistently to help you build amazing real life applications. 

```python
from elevenlabs import generate, stream

audio = generate(
    text="Hi! My name is Bella, nice to meet you!",
    voice="Bella",
    model='eleven_turbo_v2',
    stream=True
)

# Stream the audio directly 
stream(audio)
```
